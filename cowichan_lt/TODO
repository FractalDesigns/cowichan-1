Throw out LinuxTuples and replace it with a better tuple-space implementation
(good luck finding one!)
 - Winnow only works with extremely small data sets (e.g. n around 10)
   due to the problems with LinuxTuples at this point. 

Evaluate performance concerns in thresh and winnow (large loops over potential
tuples).
