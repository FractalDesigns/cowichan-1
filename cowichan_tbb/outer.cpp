/**
  This module turns a vector containing point positions into a dense, symmet-
  ric, diagonally dominant matrix by calculating the distances between each
  pair of points. It also constructs a real vector whose values are the distance
  of each point from the origin. Inputs are:

  points: a vector of (x, y) points, where x and y are the pointâ€™s position.
  nelts: the number of points in the vector, and the size of the matrix along
       each axis.

  Its outputs are:

  matrix: a real matrix, whose values are filled with inter-point distances.
  vector: a real vector, whose values are filled with origin-to-point distances.

  Each matrix element Mi,j such that i != j is given the value di,j, the Eu-
  clidean distance between point i and point j. The diagonal values Mi,i are
  then set to nelts times the maximum off-diagonal value to ensure that the
  matrix is diagonally dominant. The value of the vector element vi is set to
  the distance of point i from the origin, which is given by sqrt(xi^2 + yi^2).
